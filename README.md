all aspects of the program work.

CART and CARTITEM functionality:

For the cart class, I initialized a CARTITEM arraylist, which has reference object to product class. Each customer has a CART class
and has functions (PRINTCART, GETCART, ADDITEM, REMOVEITEM). Items will be added into the shopping cart through the ADDITEM function
into the CART's CARTITEM array list.

FILE I/O

readFile method in ECommerceSystem reads the products.txt files and creates product classes, it handles books and general items. It creates
a product class and puts into product map.
